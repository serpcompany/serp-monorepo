This project is a monorepo for the SERP project, which includes multiple applications and shared libraries. The monorepo is structured using Turborepo and pnpm, allowing for efficient management of dependencies and build processes across the various applications.

The apps and packges are Nuxt layers, which means they are Nuxt applications that can be used as layers in a larger Nuxt application. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns within the monorepo.
