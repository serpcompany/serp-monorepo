# README
- UI Library: Nuxt UI Pro (https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started)
- Our custom Nuxt UI "wrapper components" in `packages/ui/*`
- Tailwind Config Settings: Main tailwind css styles in `packages/ui/assets/css/main.css` 
- Find `apps/*` & `package/*` level tailwind config settings in `app.config.ts` files in each respective `apps/*` & `package/`

## Guidelines
- Always reference other existing project UI (components/pages/etc.) to ensure consistency in style and values across the project.
- Everything must be mobile responsive and darkmode compatible.
- Use Tailwind classes over custom CSS, make sure to follow Tailwind V4 & Nuxt UI Pro tailwind implementation preferences
