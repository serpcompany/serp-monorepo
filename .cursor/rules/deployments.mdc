# Deployment Info

We have two types of deployments:
1. Our Server (code from `packages/utils/`)
2. Cloudflare Pages via NuxtHub (code from `packages/utils-cloudflare-pages`)
  - Only apps that extend `@serp/utils-cloudflare-pages` in their nuxt.config.ts are deployed to Cloudflare Pages.


## How to determine platform

Check nuxt.config.ts to see if it extends `@serp/utils-cloudflare-pages`.
