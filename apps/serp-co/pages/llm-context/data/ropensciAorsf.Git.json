    "content": "TITLE: Fitting Verbose Random Survival Forest Model in R\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet shows how to fit a Random Survival Forest model with verbose progress output and negation-based importance calculation. It uses the 'pbc' dataset and sets a specific number of trees.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/tests/testthat/_snaps/verbosity.md#2025-04-23_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nfit_verbose <- orsf(pbc, time + status ~ ., verbose_progress = TRUE, n_tree = n_tree_test,\nimportance = \"negate\")\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Updating Regression Coefficients with Newton-Raphson Scoring in R\nDESCRIPTION: This equation demonstrates how regression coefficients are updated iteratively using the Newton-Raphson scoring method in the aorsf package. It uses the first and second derivatives of the coefficient vector to calculate the next iteration.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/joss/paper.md#2025-04-23_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\n\\hat{\\beta}^{k+1} =  \\hat{\\beta}^{k} + U(\\hat{\\beta} = \\hat{\\beta}^{k})\\, H^{-1}(\\hat{\\beta} = \\hat{\\beta}^{k})\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Fitting Verbose Random Survival Forest Model with Single Thread in R\nDESCRIPTION: This code fits a Random Survival Forest model with verbose progress, negation-based importance, and explicitly sets the number of threads to 1. It demonstrates the output messages for growing trees, computing predictions, and importance.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/tests/testthat/_snaps/verbosity.md#2025-04-23_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nfit_verbose <- orsf(pbc, time + status ~ ., verbose_progress = TRUE, n_tree = n_tree_test,\nimportance = \"negate\", n_thread = 1)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Calculating Variable Importance for Verbose RSF Model in R\nDESCRIPTION: This code calculates variable importance using the negation method for a previously fitted verbose Random Survival Forest model. It shows that the verbosity setting is carried over to subsequent operations.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/tests/testthat/_snaps/verbosity.md#2025-04-23_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nvi <- orsf_vi(fit_verbose_2, importance = \"negate\")\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Performing Variable Selection on Verbose RSF Model in R\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet performs variable selection on a verbose Random Survival Forest model. It demonstrates that the verbosity setting is retained, showing a progress indicator for the selection process.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/tests/testthat/_snaps/verbosity.md#2025-04-23_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nvs <- orsf_vs(fit_verbose)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Generating Partial Dependence Plot for Verbose RSF Model in R\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates that the verbosity setting is retained in the fitted object. It generates a partial dependence plot for the 'island' variable using out-of-bag predictions from the previously fitted verbose model.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/ropensci/aorsf.git/blob/main/tests/testthat/_snaps/verbosity.md#2025-04-23_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\npd <- orsf_pd_oob(fit_verbose, pred_spec_auto(island))\n```"
