We will be developing an oncall rotation for working on these tasks, where\nthe oncall is responsible to doing each task daily.\n\n### Issue triage\n\nRoutinely monitor the newly filed issues and triage them to make sure we identify regressions.\n\n[Kubectl repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues)\n\n[Kubernetes repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Asig%2Fcli)\n\nLook for:\n\n- Requests for help\n  - Don't spend a lot of time on these, but answer and close them if it is easy  \n- Regressions and bugs\n  - Find the root cause\n  - Triage the severity\n  - Issues only occurring in old versions but not in new versions are less severe\n- Simple issues for new contributors\n  - Label these with \"for-new-contributors\"\n  - Give them a priority\n  - Make sure they are\n    - Small\n    - Well scoped\n    - In areas of code with minimal technical debt\n    - In areas of code with strong ownership already\n- Feature requests\n  - Do one of\n    - Close them with an explanation along the lines of \"Don't have capacity right now, try reopening in 6 months\"\n    - Label them with a \"priority\"\n\n### Test triage\n\nMonitor [test grid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cli-master)\nand make sure the tests are passing.\n\nIf any tests are failing, debug them and send a fix.  Ask for help if you get stuck.\n\n### PR review\n\nMake sure PRs aren't getting stuck without attention.  If reviewers routinely don't respond\nto PRs within a few days, we should take those reviewers out of the list.\n\nLook through the PR list with [SIG cli](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Asig%2Fcli)\n\n## New contributor assistance\n\n- Look through issues labeled \"for-new-contributors\" that are assigned, and make sure they are active.\n  If they haven't had activity in a couple days, ping the assignee and ask if help is needed.\n- Identify issues for new contributors to pick up\n- Figure out a progression for new contributors to become reviewers\n\n## Per-release tasks\n\n### At the start of the dev cycle\n\n- Write planned features for each release\n  - Use the [template](../template.md)\n\n### During code-freeze\n\n- Daily look at issues labeled with [sig/cli in the milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Asig%2Fcli%20milestone%3Av1.9%20) and make sure they are owned and make progress\n  - **Note:** You will need to update the milestone in the link to the current milestone\n\n## Every 3-6 months tasks\n\n### (3 months) Report about SIG cli at the community meeting\n\nTODO: fill this in\n\n### (6 months) Setup a SIG cli face-to-face\n\nTODO: fill this in\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Using Translations in Go Code\nDESCRIPTION: Examples of how to implement translations in Go code, including basic string translation, plural forms, and error messages using the i18n package.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/master/pkg/util/i18n/translations/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: go\nCODE:\n```\nimport pkg/i18n\n...\n// Get a translated string\ntranslated := i18n.T(\"Your message in english here\")\n\n// Get a translated plural string\ntranslated := i18n.T(\"You had %d items\", items)\n\n// Translated error\nreturn i18n.Error(\"Something bad happened\")\n\n// Translated plural error\nreturn i18n.Error(\"%d bad things happened\")\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Defining Issue Labels in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet defines the labeling system for categorizing issues by size and type. It helps contributors understand the scope and complexity of tasks in the backlog.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/master/docs/maintainers/issue_backlog.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n#### Size\n- size/S\n  > 4-10 hours\n- size/M\n  > 10-20 hours\n- size/L\n  > 20+ hours\n\n#### Type (docs / tests / feature)\n\n- type/code-cleanup\n  > Usually some refactoring or small rewrites of code.\n- type/code-documentation\n  > Write doc.go with package overview and examples or document types and functions.\n- type/code-feature\n  > Usually a new go package / library for some functionality. Should be encapsulated.\n- type/code-test-coverage\n  > Audit tests for a package. Run coverage tools and also manually look at what functions are missing unit or\n  > integration tests. Write tests for these functions.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Translation Tools\nDESCRIPTION: Commands for installing required translation tools including go-xgettext for string extraction and go-bindata for code generation.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/master/pkg/util/i18n/translations/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: console\nCODE:\n```\ngo get github.com/gosexy/gettext/go-xgettext\n```\n\nLANGUAGE: console\nCODE:\n```\ngo get github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata/...\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Kubernetes Kubectl Release Roadmap Template Structure\nDESCRIPTION: A markdown template that outlines the structure for documenting planned features, technical debt cleanup, and bug fixes for upcoming kubectl releases.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/master/docs/roadmap/template.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# Release 1.X roadmap\n\n## Planned Features\n\n### Feature Y\n\nShort description\n\nOwners\n\n- Link to design proposal\n- Link to issue\n\n### Feature Z\n\nShort description\n\n- Link to design proposal\n- Link to issue\n\n## Planned Technical Debt Cleanup\n\n## Planned Bug Fixes\n\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Displaying Kubectl Namespace Operation Results\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet shows the output of kubectl commands performed on two Kubernetes namespaces. It indicates that the 'foo' namespace was unchanged, while the 'bar' namespace was pruned.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/blob/master/pkg/cmd/apply/testdata/prune/simple/manifest2-expected-apply.txt#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: plaintext\nCODE:\n```\nnamespace/foo unchanged\nnamespace/bar pruned\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Creating Kubernetes Namespaces Output\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet shows the output of successfully creating two Kubernetes namespaces using kubectl.
