Each page needs at least one\nTypoScript template either in its own properties or in an upward page.\n\nSo you need at least one page and a \"root level\" template record with\nsome content.\n\nIf you have both, go through the following:\n\nFirst, check wether the page you don't see or at least one of the pages\nin root-direction has a TypoScript template which works, is active and\nhas root-level property. To achieve this, go to the following window:\n\n:guilabel:`Template` Module in the left column > :guilabel:`page` is selected in middle column\n> :guilabel:`info/edit` in top selection field > :guilabel:`edit complete template record` >\n\"General\" - tab\n\n-  check the template TypoScript code in the \"Setup\" - text field\n-  The \"inactive\" field must be unchecked.\n-  Check, whether root-level property is set in the \"Options\" tab: the\n   \"root level\" field must be checked.\n\nIf all this is o.k., but the error occurs nonetheless, you may delete\nand re-create the root template.\n\nDelete the root template with the little trash bin on top of template\nedit page.\n\nThen create a new template by clicking \"Create template for new\nwebsite\". This button has appeared after deleting the root template.\n\nAdditionally, you find many information in the docs on TYPO3.org\n\n-  https://docs.typo3.org\n\nSOLUTION 1 (Tested with TYPO3 7+)\n=================================\n\n#.
