This will start the development server, typically on localhost:3000.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npnpm dev\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running Database Migrations - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to run database migrations using `pnpm`. This is required to set up the database schema.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npnpm db:migrate\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting Max Function Duration - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet shows how to set the maximum duration for a Vercel function by modifying the `MAX_DURATION` environment variable in the `.env` file. This is important because the default timeout might exceed the limits of certain Vercel tiers, like the Hobby tier.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nMAX_DURATION=60\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Reasoning Model Configuration - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet shows how to configure the reasoning model by setting the `REASONING_MODEL` and `BYPASS_JSON_VALIDATION` environment variables in the `.env` file.  `REASONING_MODEL` specifies the model to use for reasoning tasks, and `BYPASS_JSON_VALIDATION` is used when the model doesn't natively support JSON.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n# Choose one of: deepseek-reasoner, deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\nREASONING_MODEL=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\n\n# Required when using models that don't support JSON schema (like deepseek-reasoner)\nBYPASS_JSON_VALIDATION=true\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Dependencies - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to install the project's dependencies using `pnpm`.  `pnpm` is used as the package manager for this project.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npnpm install\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Adding TogetherAI Dependency - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to add the `@ai-sdk/togetherai` dependency using `pnpm`. This is needed if you want to use TogetherAI's models.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npnpm add @ai-sdk/togetherai\n```"
