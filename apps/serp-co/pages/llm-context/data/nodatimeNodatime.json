    "content": "TITLE: Running Tests in Noda Time with .NET SDK\nDESCRIPTION: This command executes the tests for the Noda Time project using the .NET SDK. It runs all tests in the `src/NodaTime.Test` directory and reports the results. This ensures the code changes are working as expected and haven't introduced any regressions.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ndotnet test src/NodaTime.Test\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building Noda Time Solution with .NET SDK\nDESCRIPTION: This command builds the Noda Time solution using the .NET SDK. It compiles the code and prepares it for testing or deployment. It assumes the .NET SDK is installed and configured in your environment.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ndotnet build src/NodaTime.sln\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Creating a New Branch with Git\nDESCRIPTION: This sequence of Git commands creates a new branch off the `main` branch. It first checks out the `main` branch, pulls the latest changes from the `upstream` remote, and then creates and checks out a new branch named `SOME-BRANCH-NAME`. Replace `SOME-BRANCH-NAME` with a descriptive name for your branch.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ngit checkout main\ngit pull upstream main\ngit checkout -b SOME-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Cloning Noda Time Repository with Git\nDESCRIPTION: Clones the Noda Time repository from GitHub to your local machine. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username. This creates a local copy of the repository for development.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nodatime.git\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Adding Upstream Remote for Noda Time Repository\nDESCRIPTION: Adds a remote named `upstream` pointing to the original Noda Time repository on GitHub. This allows you to fetch updates from the main repository. It's a common practice to keep your fork synchronized with the original repository.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime.git\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Pushing a Branch to Origin with Git\nDESCRIPTION: Publishes a local Git branch to your forked repository (origin) on GitHub.  `-u` sets up tracking, so future `git pull` and `git push` commands will work without specifying the remote and branch.  Replace `MY-BRANCH-NAME` with the actual branch name.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: Text\nCODE:\n```\ngit push origin -u MY-BRANCH-NAME\n```"
