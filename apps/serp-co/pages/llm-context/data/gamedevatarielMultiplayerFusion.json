Previously config's prefab table was checked; the new method allows for a more flexible approach\n- NetworkObject force remote RenderTimeFrame option\n- `NetworkObjectBaker.PostprocessBehaviour`\n- `NetworkObjectBakerEditTimeHandlerAttribute` - decorate a method with this attribute to enable NetworkBehaviour postprocessing in `NetworkObjectBakerEditTime`\n- `INetworkObjectProvider.Initialize` and `INetworkObjectProvider.Shutdown` (have default empty implementations)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Referencing Fusion Weaver Configuration Option in C#\nDESCRIPTION: Configuration option for the Fusion Weaver that, when enabled, runs the weaver automatically when weaving-related changes are detected in the config file.
