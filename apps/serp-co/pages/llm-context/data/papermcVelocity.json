This will execute the full build cycle and generate the proxy JAR file.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/papermc/velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\n./gradlew build\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing CMake on macOS with Homebrew (Bash)\nDESCRIPTION: Uses the Homebrew package manager (`brew`) to install the `cmake` build tool, which is a prerequisite for compiling the native libraries on macOS. Assumes Homebrew is already installed on the system.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/papermc/velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/native/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nbrew install cmake\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building All Linux Natives with Docker (Bash)\nDESCRIPTION: Executes the `build-all-linux-natives.sh` script located in the `build-support` directory to compile native libraries for Linux (x86_64 and aarch64) using Docker. Requires Docker with multi-platform build capabilities configured. This script handles building for both OpenSSL 1.1.x and 3.x.x versions.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/papermc/velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/native/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n./build-support/build-all-linux-natives.sh\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building macOS Natives (Bash)\nDESCRIPTION: Executes the `compile-macos.sh` script located in the `build-support` directory to compile native libraries specifically for macOS aarch64 (\"Apple Silicon\"). Requires `cmake` to be installed (e.g., via Homebrew). Building on x86_64 macOS might work but is untested.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/papermc/velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/native/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n./build-support/compile-macos.sh\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Example Individual Linux Build Scripts (Bash)\nDESCRIPTION: Lists the individual shell scripts (`compile-linux-compress.sh` and `compile-linux-crypto.sh`) located in `build-support` that are used to build the compression and cryptography components separately on Linux. These can serve as a starting point for building on other Unix-like systems, requiring manual adjustments and installation of dependencies like a C/C++ toolchain, CMake, and OpenSSL.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/papermc/velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/native/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nbuild-support/compile-linux-compress.sh\n```\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nbuild-support/compile-linux-crypto.sh\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: GPL v3 License Header Template for Velocity\nDESCRIPTION: The standard GNU General Public License v3 header that should be included at the top of all source files in the Velocity project.
