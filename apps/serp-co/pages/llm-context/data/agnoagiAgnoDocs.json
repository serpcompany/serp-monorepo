It configures the agent with `file_search` and `web_search_preview` tools. The script then calls the agent with a prompt asking it to summarize the contents of a PDF file provided via a URL and perform a web search for more information. Finally, it prints the agent's response and any citations generated.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/models/openai/responses/pdf_input_url.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\n```python cookbook/models/openai/responses/pdf_input_url.py\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.media import File\nfrom agno.models.openai.responses import OpenAIResponses\n\nagent = Agent(\n    model=OpenAIResponses(id=\"gpt-4o-mini\"),\n    tools=[{\"type\": \"file_search\"}, {\"type\": \"web_search_preview\"}],\n    markdown=True,\n)\n\nagent.print_response(\n    \"Summarize the contents of the attached file and search the web for more information.\",\n    files=[File(url=\"https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf\")],\n)\n\nprint(\"Citations:\")\nprint(agent.run_response.citations)\n```\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Defining and Running a Collaborate Mode Team with Agno (Python)\nDESCRIPTION: This Python script defines a team of agents, each specialized for distinct research platforms, using the Agno library.

Required dependencies include Agno, asyncio, openai, duckduckgo-search, arxiv, pypdf, googlesearch-python, and pycountry. The script expects a query string input and outputs a consensus report, with the support for streaming and intermediate step visualization.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/teams/collaborate.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nimport asyncio\\nfrom textwrap import dedent\\n\\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\\nfrom agno.team.team import Team\\nfrom agno.tools.arxiv import ArxivTools\\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\\nfrom agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools\\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\\n\\nreddit_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Reddit Researcher\\\",\\n    role=\\\"Research a topic on Reddit\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a Reddit researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on Reddit.\\n    You will need to find the most relevant posts on Reddit.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\nhackernews_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"HackerNews Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research a topic on HackerNews.\\\",\\n    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a HackerNews researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on HackerNews.\\n    You will need to find the most relevant posts on HackerNews.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\nacademic_paper_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Academic Paper Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research academic papers and scholarly content\\\",\\n    tools=[GoogleSearchTools(), ArxivTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a academic paper researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research in academic literature.\\n    You will need to find relevant scholarly articles, papers, and academic discussions.\\n    Focus on peer-reviewed content and citations from reputable sources.\\n    Provide brief summaries of key findings and methodologies.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\ntwitter_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Twitter Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research trending discussions and real-time updates\\\",\\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a Twitter/X researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on Twitter/X.\\n    You will need to find trending discussions, influential voices, and real-time updates.\\n    Focus on verified accounts and credible sources when possible.\\n    Track relevant hashtags and ongoing conversations.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\n\\nagent_team = Team(\\n    name=\\\"Discussion Team\\\",\\n    mode=\\\"collaborate\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    members=[\\n        reddit_researcher,\\n        hackernews_researcher,\\n        academic_paper_researcher,\\n        twitter_researcher,\\n    ],\\n    instructions=[\\n        \\\"You are a discussion master.\\\",\\n        \\\"You have to stop the discussion when you think the team has reached a consensus.\\\",\\n    ],\\n    success_criteria=\\\"The team has reached a consensus.\\\",\\n    enable_agentic_context=True,\\n    show_tool_calls=True,\\n    markdown=True,\\n    show_members_responses=True,\\n)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    asyncio.run(\\n        agent_team.print_response(\\n            message=\\\"Start the discussion on the topic: 'What is the best way to learn to code?'\\\",\\n            stream=True,\\n            stream_intermediate_steps=True,\\n        )\\n    )\\n\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Streaming Audio Responses with Agno OpenAIChat Agent in Python\nDESCRIPTION: This Python snippet sets up an Agno Agent using the OpenAIChat model to handle both text and audio modalities for a given prompt. It streams the audio responses as base64-encoded PCM data, decodes them, and writes the audio frames to a mono, 16-bit WAV file with a sample rate of 24000 Hz. Requires the agno and openai Python libraries, an active OpenAI API key, and a writable \"tmp\" directory for output files. Key dependencies include agno.agent, agno.models.openai, base64, and wave. The 'stream=True' option in agent.run enables incremental audio streaming. Outputs both the text transcript and WAV audio; handles exceptions during audio decoding.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/concepts/multimodal/audio-streaming.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nimport base64\\nimport wave\\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\n# Audio Configuration\\nSAMPLE_RATE = 24000  # Hz (24kHz)\\nCHANNELS = 1  # Mono\\nSAMPLE_WIDTH = 2  # Bytes (16 bits)\\n\\nagent = Agent(\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\n        id=\"gpt-4o-audio-preview\",\\n        modalities=[\"text\", \"audio\"],\\n        audio={\\n            \"voice\": \"alloy\",\\n            \"format\": \"pcm16\",  # Required for streaming\\n        },\\n    ),\\n    debug_mode=True,\\n    add_history_to_messages=True,\\n)\\n\\n# Question with streaming\\noutput_stream: Iterator[RunResponse] = agent.run(\\n    \"Is a golden retriever a good family dog?\", \\n    stream=True\\n)\\n\\nwith wave.open(\"tmp/answer_1.wav\", \"wb\") as wav_file:\\n    wav_file.setnchannels(CHANNELS)\\n    wav_file.setsampwidth(SAMPLE_WIDTH)\\n    wav_file.setframerate(SAMPLE_RATE)\\n    \\n    for response in output_stream:\\n        if response.response_audio:\\n            if response.response_audio.transcript:\\n                print(response.response_audio.transcript, end=\"\", flush=True)\\n            if response.response_audio.content:\\n                try:\\n                    pcm_bytes = base64.b64decode(response.response_audio.content)\\n                    wav_file.writeframes(pcm_bytes)\\n                except Exception as e:\\n                    print(f\"Error decoding audio: {e}\")\\nprint()\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building a Thai Cuisine AI Agent with Knowledge Base and Web Search in Python\nDESCRIPTION: This code creates an AI cooking assistant specialized in Thai cuisine using Agno.

AirflowTools is initialized with configuration options, and the agent is used to execute commands that create a new DAG file ('example_dag.py') from a multi-line string and subsequently read its contents. Dependencies include the 'agno.agent' and 'agno.tools.airflow' modules, as well as the Airflow library itself for the DAG content. The snippet expects the Airflow environment to exist and supports directory/path configuration for DAG storage. The main parameters are 'dags_dir' (filesystem path for DAG files), and boolean flags to enable save/read functions. The output is the successful creation and retrieval of a sample Airflow DAG Python script, enabling automated workflow management. Limitations include reliance on proper agent and tool initialization, and the existence of required directories and dependencies.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/tools/toolkits/others/airflow.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.tools.airflow import AirflowTools\n\nagent = Agent(\n    tools=[AirflowTools(dags_dir=\"dags\", save_dag=True, read_dag=True)], show_tool_calls=True, markdown=True\n)\n\ndag_content = \"\"\"\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\ndefault_args = {\n    'owner': 'airflow',\n    'depends_on_past': False,\n    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),\n    'email_on_failure': False,\n    'email_on_retry': False,\n    'retries': 1,\n    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),\n}\n# Using 'schedule' instead of deprecated 'schedule_interval'\nwith DAG(\n    'example_dag',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    description='A simple example DAG',\n    schedule='@daily',  # Changed from schedule_interval\n    catchup=False\n) as dag:\n    def print_hello():\n        print(\"Hello from Airflow!\")\n        return \"Hello task completed\"\n    task = PythonOperator(\n        task_id='hello_task',\n        python_callable=print_hello,\n        dag=dag,\n    )\n\"\"\"\n\nagent.run(f\"Save this DAG file as 'example_dag.py': {dag_content}\")\n\nagent.print_response(\"Read the contents of 'example_dag.py'\")\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Performing Basic Memory Operations with Agno Library in Python\nDESCRIPTION: This script demonstrates how to use the Agno library to perform basic memory operations.

An example query demonstrates routing, and an assertion checks that the response content is an instance of the expected Pydantic model (`StockAnalysis`). Dependencies include `agno`, `pydantic`, `openai`, and assumes a `YFinanceTools` implementation.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/teams/route.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\nfrom agno.team import Team\n\n\nclass StockAnalysis(BaseModel):\n    symbol: str\n    company_name: str\n    analysis: str\n\nclass CompanyAnalysis(BaseModel):\n    company_name: str\n    analysis: str\n\nstock_searcher = Agent(\n    name=\"Stock Searcher\",\n    model=OpenAIChat(\"gpt-4o\"),\n    response_model=StockAnalysis,\n    role=\"Searches for information on stocks and provides price analysis.\",\n    tools=[\n        YFinanceTools(\n            stock_price=True,\n            analyst_recommendations=True,\n        )\n    ],\n)\n\ncompany_info_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Company Info Searcher\",\n    model=OpenAIChat(\"gpt-4o\"),\n    role=\"Searches for information about companies and recent news.\",\n    response_model=CompanyAnalysis,\n    tools=[\n        YFinanceTools(\n            stock_price=False,\n            company_info=True,\n            company_news=True,\n        )\n    ],\n)\n\nteam = Team(\n    name=\"Stock Research Team\",\n    mode=\"route\",\n    model=OpenAIChat(\"gpt-4o\"),\n    members=[stock_searcher, company_info_agent],\n    markdown=True,\n)\n\n# This should route to the stock_searcher\nresponse = team.run(\"What is the current stock price of NVDA?\")\nassert isinstance(response.content, StockAnalysis)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Generating and Narrating Image-Based Stories with agno and OpenAI (Python)\nDESCRIPTION: This Python snippet processes a local image and instructs an LLM agent to compose a three-sentence fictional story about the image.

When executed, the script initiates a discussion among all agents on the provided topic, streaming their interactions. Prerequisites: agno, openai, duckduckgo-search, arxiv, pypdf, googlesearch-python, pycountry. Inputs: discussion topic via message. Outputs: streamed discussion responses showing research and consensus-building. Constraints include reliance on specific tools and available environment variables (namely, OPENAI_API_KEY).\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/examples/teams/collaborate/discussion_team.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nimport asyncio\\nfrom textwrap import dedent\\n\\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\\nfrom agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat\\nfrom agno.team.team import Team\\nfrom agno.tools.arxiv import ArxivTools\\nfrom agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools\\nfrom agno.tools.googlesearch import GoogleSearchTools\\nfrom agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools\\n\\nreddit_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Reddit Researcher\\\",\\n    role=\\\"Research a topic on Reddit\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(id=\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a Reddit researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on Reddit.\\n    You will need to find the most relevant posts on Reddit.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\nhackernews_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"HackerNews Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research a topic on HackerNews.\\\",\\n    tools=[HackerNewsTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a HackerNews researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on HackerNews.\\n    You will need to find the most relevant posts on HackerNews.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\nacademic_paper_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Academic Paper Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research academic papers and scholarly content\\\",\\n    tools=[GoogleSearchTools(), ArxivTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a academic paper researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research in academic literature.\\n    You will need to find relevant scholarly articles, papers, and academic discussions.\\n    Focus on peer-reviewed content and citations from reputable sources.\\n    Provide brief summaries of key findings and methodologies.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\ntwitter_researcher = Agent(\\n    name=\\\"Twitter Researcher\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    role=\\\"Research trending discussions and real-time updates\\\",\\n    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],\\n    add_name_to_instructions=True,\\n    instructions=dedent(\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are a Twitter/X researcher.\\n    You will be given a topic to research on Twitter/X.\\n    You will need to find trending discussions, influential voices, and real-time updates.\\n    Focus on verified accounts and credible sources when possible.\\n    Track relevant hashtags and ongoing conversations.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"),\\n)\\n\\n\\nagent_team = Team(\\n    name=\\\"Discussion Team\\\",\\n    mode=\\\"collaborate\\\",\\n    model=OpenAIChat(\\\"gpt-4o\\\"),\\n    members=[\\n        reddit_researcher,\\n        hackernews_researcher,\\n        academic_paper_researcher,\\n        twitter_researcher,\\n    ],\\n    instructions=[\\n        \\\"You are a discussion master.\\\",\\n        \\\"You have to stop the discussion when you think the team has reached a consensus.\\\",\\n    ],\\n    success_criteria=\\\"The team has reached a consensus.\\\",\\n    send_team_context_to_members=True,\\n    update_team_context=True,\\n    show_tool_calls=True,\\n    markdown=True,\\n    debug_mode=True,\\n    show_members_responses=True,\\n)\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    asyncio.run(\\n        agent_team.print_response(\\n            message=\\\"Start the discussion on the topic: 'What is the best way to learn to code?'\\\",\\n            stream=True,\\n            stream_intermediate_steps=True,\\n        )\\n    )\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Asynchronous Execution of Multiple AI Agents using Agno in Python\nDESCRIPTION: This script creates multiple AI agents using the Agno library, each tasked with writing a report on a different AI provider.

an Agno `Agent` with a `Clickhouse` vector database. It sets up the Agent similarly to the synchronous example, using `SqliteAgentStorage` and a `PDFUrlKnowledgeBase` backed by ClickHouse. The key difference is the use of asynchronous methods: `agent.knowledge.aload()` loads the knowledge base data non-blockingly, and `agent.aprint_response()` interacts with the agent asynchronously. Both are executed within an `asyncio.run()` call, suitable for applications requiring concurrency and better performance.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/agno-agi/agno-docs/blob/main/vectordb/clickhouse.mdx#2025-04-22_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\n# async_clickhouse.py\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase\nfrom agno.storage.agent.sqlite import SqliteAgentStorage\nfrom agno.vectordb.clickhouse import Clickhouse\n\nagent = Agent(\n    storage=SqliteAgentStorage(table_name=\"recipe_agent\"),\n    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(\n        urls=[\"https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf\"],\n        vector_db=Clickhouse(\n            table_name=\"recipe_documents\",\n            host=\"localhost\",\n            port=8123,\n            username=\"ai\",\n            password=\"ai\",\n        ),\n    ),\n    # Show tool calls in the response\n    show_tool_calls=True,\n    # Enable the agent to search the knowledge base\n    search_knowledge=True,\n    # Enable the agent to read the chat history\n    read_chat_history=True,\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Comment out after first run\n    asyncio.run(agent.knowledge.aload(recreate=False))\n\n    # Create and use the agent\n    asyncio.run(agent.aprint_response(\"How to make Tom Kha Gai\", markdown=True))\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Creating Python virtual environment (Mac)\nDESCRIPTION: This command creates a Python virtual environment named `.venv` and activates it.
