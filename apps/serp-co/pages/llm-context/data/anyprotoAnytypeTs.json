These dependencies are prerequisites for building and running the Anytype client on these systems. The commands must be run with appropriate permissions; adjust as needed for your environment.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\napt install libsecret-1-dev\\napt install jq\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Dependencies using Fedora Package Manager (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Uses dnf to install libsecret and jq libraries on Fedora distributions. These system libraries are required dependencies for the Anytype client setup and should be installed with appropriate privileges.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\ndnf install libsecret\\ndnf install jq\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Dependencies using Alpine Package Manager (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Adds libsecret and jq packages using apk for Alpine Linux, which is often used in container environments. These libraries are required for compiling and operating the Anytype client within Alpine-based setups.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\napk add libsecret\\napk add jq\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Updating Middleware Binaries using Script (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Runs the update.sh script to fetch or update middleware binaries for the target platform and CPU architecture. The script should be run from within the project directory. Valid OS/arch combinations must be specified as arguments.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\n./update.sh <macos-latest|ubuntu-latest|windows-latest> <arm|amd> # arm/amd only for macos/ubuntu\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Cloning and Installing Dependencies for the Anytype Repository (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to clone the Anytype TS repository and install its npm dependencies in development mode. The commands must be executed sequentially in a shell. Requires npm and git to be installed on the system.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts\\ncd anytype-ts\\nnpm install -D\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Moving Middleware Binary into Project Dist Folder (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Contains shell commands to move the anytypeHelper binary into the project's dist directory for MacOS and Linux. The user must choose the appropriate move command for their OS and CPU type after downloading or building the middleware binary.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_6\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\nmv darwin-*/anytypeHelper dist/\n```\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\nmv linux-*/anytypeHelper dist/\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running the Anytype Project with Environment Variables (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to launch the development version of the Anytype client locally by setting SERVER_PORT and ANYPROF environment variables before starting the application. Variations are provided for MacOS/Linux and Windows platforms. The server port and profiler port can be customized by replacing the placeholders.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_8\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\nSERVER_PORT=<PORT> ANYPROF=:<PROFILER_PORT> npm run start:dev\n```\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\nSERVER_PORT=<PORT> ANYPROF=:<PROFILER_PORT> npm run start:dev-win\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Dependencies using Arch-based Package Manager (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Installs libsecret and jq using pacman for Arch-derived distributions like Manjaro. These dependencies are needed for the application to build and run correctly. Proper user privileges are assumed.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\npacman -S libsecret\\npacman -S jq\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building the Anytype Project with npm Scripts (Shell)\nDESCRIPTION: Runs build commands to update localization files and produce distributable binaries for the project on supported platforms. These npm scripts prepare the application for production or testing. The user must select the correct build script for their operating system.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_7\n\nLANGUAGE: shell\nCODE:\n```\nnpm run update:locale\\nnpm run dist:(mac|win|linux)\n```"
