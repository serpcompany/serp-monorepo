    "content": "TITLE: Initializing a Basic Crawler with Colly in Go\nDESCRIPTION: This Go code snippet demonstrates how to set up a simple web crawler using the Colly framework. It initializes a new collector, attaches event handlers for processing HTML anchor tags and for logging requests, and starts crawling from a specified URL. To run this example, the 'github.com/gocolly/colly/v2' package must be imported and installed. The snippet expects a starting URL and uses OnHTML callbacks to find and visit all hyperlinks on the target page, printing out each visited URL to the standard output.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: go\nCODE:\n```\nfunc main() {\n\tc := colly.NewCollector()\n\n\t// Find and visit all links\n\tc.OnHTML(\"a[href]\", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) {\n\t\te.Request.Visit(e.Attr(\"href\"))\n\t})\n\n\tc.OnRequest(func(r *colly.Request) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Visiting\", r.URL)\n\t})\n\n\tc.Visit(\"http://go-colly.org/\")\n}\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing Colly Dependency via go.mod in Go\nDESCRIPTION: This code snippet shows the minimal addition to a Go project's go.mod file to declare a dependency on the Colly framework at the latest version. It specifies the module path for your project, the Go version, and adds 'github.com/gocolly/colly/v2' as a required dependency. This is necessary to ensure the Colly package is properly tracked and available for import in your Go project. Replace 'github.com/x/y' with your actual module path as appropriate.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: go\nCODE:\n```\nmodule github.com/x/y\n\ngo 1.14\n\nrequire (\n        github.com/gocolly/colly/v2 latest\n)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running a Colly Example with Go - Bash\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to execute a Colly example using the Go runtime through the command line. It requires Go to be installed and assumes that the relevant example exists in the specified path. The command runs the Go source file for a specific Colly example, allowing users to test or experiment with individual scraper functionalities. Input: the path to a valid example.go file; output: the program's console logs.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/_examples/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n$ go run rate_limit/rate_limit.go\n[000001] 1 [     1 - request] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=4\"] (60.872µs)\n[000002] 1 [     2 - request] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=2\"] (154.425µs)\n[000003] 1 [     3 - request] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=0\"] (158.374µs)\n[000004] 1 [     5 - request] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=3\"] (426.999µs)\n[000005] 1 [     4 - request] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=1\"] (448.75µs)\n[000007] 1 [     2 - response] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=2\" \"status\":\"OK\"] (2.855764394s)\n[000008] 1 [     2 - scraped] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=2\"] (2.855797868s)\n[000006] 1 [     1 - response] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=4\" \"status\":\"OK\"] (2.855756753s)\n[000009] 1 [     1 - scraped] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=4\"] (2.855819581s)\n[000010] 1 [     3 - response] map[\"status\":\"OK\" \"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=0\"] (5.002065299s)\n[000011] 1 [     3 - scraped] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=0\"] (5.002103755s)\n[000012] 1 [     5 - response] map[\"status\":\"OK\" \"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=3\"] (5.012080614s)\n[000013] 1 [     5 - scraped] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=3\"] (5.012101056s)\n[000014] 1 [     4 - response] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=1\" \"status\":\"OK\"] (7.155725591s)\n[000015] 1 [     4 - scraped] map[\"url\":\"https://httpbin.org/delay/2?n=1\"] (7.155759136s)\n\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Documenting Colly Version 2.0.0 Release Notes\nDESCRIPTION: Details the changes in Colly version 2.0.0, including breaking changes, new features like Go module support and HasVisited method, and multiple bugfixes.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: Markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# 2.0.0 - 2019.11.28\n\n - Breaking change: Change Collector.RedirectHandler member to Collector.SetRedirectHandler function\n - Go module support\n - Collector.HasVisited method added to be able to check if an url has been visited\n - Collector.SetClient method introduced\n - HTMLElement.ChildTexts method added\n - New user agents\n - Multiple bugfixes\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Documenting Colly Version 2.1.0 Release Notes\nDESCRIPTION: Lists the changes and improvements in Colly version 2.1.0, including new features like HTTP tracing support and OnResponseHeader callback, as well as various fixes and dependency updates.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: Markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# 2.1.0 - 2020.06.09\n\n - HTTP tracing support\n - New callback: OnResponseHeader\n - Queue fixes\n - New collector option: Collector.CheckHead\n - Proxy fixes\n - Fixed POST revisit checking\n - Updated dependencies\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Documenting Colly Version 1.2.0 Release Notes\nDESCRIPTION: Outlines the updates in Colly version 1.2.0, including compatibility improvements, new request shortcuts, and various bug fixes and enhancements.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: Markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# 1.2.0 - 2019.02.13\n\n - Compatibility with the latest htmlquery package\n - New request shortcut for HEAD requests\n - Check URL availibility before visiting\n - Fix proxy URL value\n - Request counter fix\n - Minor fixes in examples\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Documenting Colly Version 1.1.0 Release Notes\nDESCRIPTION: Lists the changes in Colly version 1.1.0, including API changes for Appengine integration, new features like gzip decompression support, and various bug fixes and improvements.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/gocolly/colly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: Markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# 1.1.0 - 2018.08.13\n\n - Appengine integration takes context.Context instead of http.Request (API change)\n - Added \"Accept\" http header by default to every request\n - Support slices of pointers in unmarshal\n - Fixed a race condition in queues\n - ForEachWithBreak method added to HTMLElement\n - Added a local file example\n - Support gzip decompression of response bodies\n - Don't share waitgroup when cloning a collector\n - Fixed instagram example\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Documenting Colly Version 1.0.0 Release\nDESCRIPTION: Marks the initial stable release of Colly version 1.0.0.
