    "content": "TITLE: Reading a DICOM image file with gdcm\nDESCRIPTION: This code snippet demonstrates how to read a DICOM image file using the gdcm library. It imports the gdcm module, creates an ImageReader object, sets the file name, reads the file, and checks for errors. The 'dicom_image_file.dcm' file must be present in the working directory or a valid path should be specified.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nimport gdcm\nreader = gdcm.ImageReader()\nreader.SetFileName(\"dicom_image_file.dcm\")\nret = reader.Read()\nif not ret:\n    print(\"It was not possible to read your DICOM file\")\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Installing python-gdcm using pip\nDESCRIPTION: This command installs the python-gdcm package using pip. The -U flag ensures that the package is upgraded if it's already installed.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npip install -U python-gdcm\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Testing the python-gdcm installation\nDESCRIPTION: This command tests the installation of the python-gdcm package by importing the 'gdcm' module and printing the GDCM version. If a ModuleNotFoundError occurs, it indicates that the '_gdcm' module could not be found. This can be resolved by ensuring the working directory doesn't contain a '_gdcm' folder.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npython -c \"import gdcm; print(gdcm.GDCM_VERSION)\"\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Building and installing python-gdcm from source\nDESCRIPTION: This command builds and installs the python-gdcm package from the source code. The trailing slash is important, it tells pip to install from the current directory.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n# Note the trailing slash!\npip install python-gdcm/\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Cloning the python-gdcm source code\nDESCRIPTION: This command clones the python-gdcm repository from GitHub, including all submodules. The --recurse-submodules flag ensures that any Git submodules are also initialized and updated.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting environment variables for CMake and SWIG\nDESCRIPTION: These commands set environment variables for the CMake and SWIG executables. This is necessary if these executables are not in the system's PATH. The paths should be updated to the actual locations of the executables.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/tfmoraes/python-gdcm/blob/master/README.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nexport CMAKE_EXE=\"path/to/cmake/executable\"\nexport SWIG_EXE=\"path/to/swig/executable\"\n```"
