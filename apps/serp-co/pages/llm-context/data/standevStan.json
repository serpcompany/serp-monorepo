This allows users to compile Stan models directly from within the R environment.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/src/stanc.cpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan R Interface\nDESCRIPTION: Defines the primary R interface for interacting with Stan models. This file likely contains functions for compiling, running, and analyzing Stan models from within R.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/R/rstan.R\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Generated C++ Source\nDESCRIPTION: Represents generated C++ code from Stan models.  The YYY placeholder indicates the Stan model name and XXX the stan file name. This highlights the code generation process that translates Stan models into C++ for efficient execution.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/src/YYY__XXX.cpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan Core Classes\nDESCRIPTION: Defines core classes related to Stan fits and arguments in C++ within the RStan package. These headers likely contain definitions for managing Stan model parameters and data within the R environment.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/inst/include/rstan/stan_fit.hpp\nrstan/rstan/inst/include/rstan/stan_args.hpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Stan Compiler (stanc) Command Line\nDESCRIPTION: Implementation of the Stan compiler, stanc, as a command-line tool in C++.  This is the program responsible for translating Stan models into C++ code.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nstan/command/stanc.cpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan Chains Implementation\nDESCRIPTION: Provides the R implementation for handling and processing MCMC chains generated by Stan. This includes functionalities for summarizing and visualizing the results.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_6\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/src/chains.cpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: MCMC Chains Management\nDESCRIPTION: Defines data structures and algorithms for managing MCMC chains within the Stan framework, crucial for analyzing the output of Stan models.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nstan/mcmc/chains.hpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RList Variable Context\nDESCRIPTION: Provides an implementation for variable context using R lists, allowing Stan models to access data stored in R lists.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_7\n\nLANGUAGE: C++\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/inst/include/rstan/io/rlist_ref_var_context.hpp\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan Makefiles\nDESCRIPTION: Specifies the build process for RStan using makefiles, including instructions for compiling C++ code and linking libraries. The .win extension indicates Windows-specific configurations.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_8\n\nLANGUAGE: Makefile\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/src/Makefile{,.win}\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan Options Configuration\nDESCRIPTION: Configures various options for RStan, such as specifying the versions of Boost and Eigen libraries used. This ensures compatibility and proper functioning of the RStan package.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_9\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/R/options.R\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: RStan Author List\nDESCRIPTION: Lists the authors and contributors to the RStan package, providing credit and acknowledging their contributions.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/RELEASE-NOTES.txt#_snippet_10\n\nLANGUAGE: R\nCODE:\n```\nrstan/rstan/DESCRIPTION\nrstan/rstan/man/rstan.Rd\n```"
