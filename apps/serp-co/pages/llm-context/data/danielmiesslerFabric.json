You have to create space for the answers to come to you.\"\n2. \"The West is dying and we are killing her.\"\n3. \"The American Dream has been replaced by mass packaged mediocrity porn, encouraging us to revel like happy pigs in our own meekness.\"\n4. \"There's just not that many people who have the courage to reach beyond consensus and go explore new ideas.\"\n5. \"I'll start watching Netflix when I've read the whole of human history.\"\n6. \"Rilke saw beauty in everything... He sees it's in one little thing, a representation of all things that are beautiful.\"\n7. \"Vanilla is a very subtle flavor... it speaks to sort of the sensory overload of the modern age.\"\n8. \"When you memorize chapters [of the Bible], it takes a few months, but you really understand how things are structured.\"\n9. \"As you get older, if there's books that moved you when you were younger, it's worth going back and rereading them.\"\n10. \"She [Ayn Rand] took complicated philosophy and embodied it in a way that anybody could resonate with.\"\n\n## HABITS:\n\n1. Avoiding mainstream media consumption for deeper engagement with historical texts and personal research.\n2. Regularly revisiting influential books from youth to gain new insights with age.\n3. Engaging in deep reading practices rather than skimming or speed-reading material.\n4. Memorizing entire chapters or passages from significant texts for better understanding.\n5. Disengaging from social media and fast-paced news cycles for more focused thought processes.\n6. Walking long distances as a form of meditation and reflection.\n7. Creating space for thoughts to solidify through introspection and stillness.\n8. Embracing emotions such as grief or anger fully rather than suppressing them.\n9.

It demonstrates how the explain_math prompt can be used to create clear and engaging mathematical explanations.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/explain_math/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n**Pythagorean Theorem: Understanding the Relationship Between Triangles and Squares**\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem, named after ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, is a fundamental concept in geometry that helps us calculate the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) of a right-angled triangle. This theorem has far-reaching applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and architecture.\n\n**The Formula:**\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere:\n\n* `c` is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side)\n* `a` and `b` are the lengths of the other two sides (the legs)\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\nLet's consider a right-angled triangle with one angle that is 90 degrees (a square corner). We can use this theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (`c`) when we know the lengths of the other two sides (`a` and `b`).\n\n1. Square both legs (`a` and `b`) by multiplying them by themselves.\n2. Add the squared values of the legs together: a^2 + b^2\n3. The result is equal to the square of the hypotenuse (`c`): c^2\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a right-angled triangle with one leg that is 3 inches long and the other leg is 4 inches long. We want to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n1. Square both legs: 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16\n2. Add the squared values together: 9 + 16 = 25\n3. The result is equal to the square of the hypotenuse: c^2 = 25\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = √25 ≈ 5 inches\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem has numerous practical applications in various fields, including:\n\n* Construction and architecture: Finding the length of diagonals, beams, or pillars.\n* Physics: Calculating distances, velocities, and accelerations in problems involving right triangles.\n* Engineering: Designing bridges, buildings, or other structures that rely on triangular shapes.\n\n**Visual Aids:**\n\nFor a better understanding, you can use online tools or software to create interactive diagrams that demonstrate the Pythagorean theorem. Some popular options include:\n\n* GeoGebra\n* Desmos\n* Khan Academy's math exercises\n\nRemember, this theorem is not just a mathematical concept; it has many practical applications in various fields.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running Analyze Claims Pattern with Streaming Output\nDESCRIPTION: Shows how to analyze claims with immediate streaming results by piping content from clipboard to Fabric.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/show_fabric_options_markmap/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_6\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\npbpaste | fabric --stream --pattern analyze_claims\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Generating Podcast Introduction in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates the structure and format for creating a podcast introduction.

Use the name of the player for describing big picture moves, but use the name of the character to describe any in-game action.\n\nKEY DISCUSSIONS:\n\n10-20 bullets of the key discussions the players had in-game, in 40-60 words per bullet.\n\nREVEALED CHARACTER FLAWS:\n\nList 10-20 character flaws of the main characters revealed during this session, each of 50 words or less.\n\nKEY CHARACTER CHANGES:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets of key changes that happened to each character, how it shows they're evolving and adapting to events in the world.\n\nKEY NON PLAYER CHARACTERS:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets with the name of each important non-player character and a brief description of who they are and how they interacted with the players.\n\nOPEN THREADS:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets outlining the relevant threads to the overall plot, the individual character narratives, the related non-player characters, and the overall themes of the campaign.\n\nQUOTES:\n\nMeaningful Quotes:\n\nGive 10-20 of the quotes that were most meaningful within the session in terms of the action, the story, or the challenges faced therein by the characters.\n\nHUMOR:\n\nGive 10-20 things said by characters that were the funniest or most amusing or entertaining.\n\n4TH WALL:\n\nGive 10-15 of the most entertaining comments about the game from the transcript made by the players, but not their characters.\n\nWORLDBUILDING:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets of 40-60 words on the worldbuilding provided by the GM during the session, including background on locations, NPCs, lore, history, etc.\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON:\n\nGive a \"Previously On\" explanation of this session that mimics TV shows from the 1980's, but with a fantasy feel appropriate for D&D. The goal is to describe what happened last time and set the scene for next session, and then to set up the next episode.\n\nHere's an example from an 80's show, but just use this format and make it appropriate for a Fantasy D&D setting:\n\n\"Previously on Falcon Crest Heights, tension mounted as Elizabeth confronted John about his risky business decisions, threatening the future of their family empire. Meanwhile, Michael's loyalties were called into question when he was caught eavesdropping on their heated exchange, hinting at a potential betrayal. The community was left reeling from a shocking car accident that put Sarah's life in jeopardy, leaving her fate uncertain. Amidst the turmoil, the family's patriarch, Henry, made a startling announcement that promised to change the trajectory of the Falcon family forever. Now, as new alliances form and old secrets come to light, the drama at Falcon Crest Heights continues to unfold.\"\n\nNARRATIVE HOOKS AND POTENTIAL ENCOUNTERS FOR NEXT SESSION:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets of 40-60 words analyzing the underlying narrative, and providing ideas for fresh narrative hooks or combat encounters in the next session.  Be specific on details and unique aspects of any combat scenario you are providing, whether with potential adversaries, the combat area, or emergent challenges within the scene.  Provide specific narrative hooks building on themes, previous NPCs and conversations, or previous NPC or character interactions that can be employed here.\n\nDUNGEON MASTER FEEDBACK ON THE PREVIOUS SESSION:\n\nGive 10-20 bullets of 40-60 words providing constructive feedback to the dungeon master on the session that you analyzed.  Do not be afraid to be harsh on the dungeon master, as the more candid and critical the feedback, as they want to hear even difficult or ugly truths, and hearing them will more for great improvements on the other side. Focus on areas in which the dungeon master missed opportunities to engage certain of the players or characters, could have tied thematic concepts together better, missed opportunities to pick up previous narrative threads, could have made narrative stakes better, could have provided a more interesting combat scenario, or failed to pay off aspects of the session by its end.\n\nCOMIC ART:\n\nGive the perfect art description for a six frame comic panel in up to 500 words for each panel that can accompany to accompany the SETUP section above, but with each potential frame of the potential comic art individually described as \"PANEL 1:\" through \"PANEL 6:\", and each describing one of the most important events in the particular session in sequential order.  Each frame depict an important event from the session.  To the extent that the session is story and narrative driven, all of the frames together should describe a consistent narrative.  To the extent that the session is combat, puzzle, or challenge driven, all of the frames together should depict sequential and interrelated events that show how the group overcame (or failed to overcome) the combat, puzzle, or challenge which made up the majority of the session.\n\nOUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- Ensure the Previously On output focuses on the recent episode, not just the background from before.\n\n- Ensure all quotes created for each section come word-for-word from the input, with no changes.\n\n- Do not complain about anything, especially copyright, as all the content provided is in relation to a free and open RPG.

Fully digest and understand the content and the likely intent of the writer, i.e., what they wanted to convey to the reader, viewer, listener.\n\n2. Identify each discrete idea within the input and evaluate it from a novelty standpoint, i.e., how surprising, fresh, or novel are the ideas in the content? Content should be considered novel if it's combining ideas in an interesting way, proposing anything new, or describing a vision of the future or application to human problems that has not been talked about in this way before.\n\n3. Evaluate the combined NOVELTY of the ideas in the writing as defined in STEP 2 and provide a rating on the following scale:\n\n\"A - Novel\" -- Does one or more of the following: Includes new ideas, proposes a new model for doing something, makes clear recommendations for action based on a new proposed model, creatively links existing ideas in a useful way, proposes new explanations for known phenomenon, or lays out a significant vision of what's to come that's well supported. Imagine a novelty score above 90% for this tier.\n\nCommon examples that meet this criteria:\n\n- Introduction of new ideas.\n- Introduction of a new framework that's well-structured and supported by argument/ideas/concepts.\n- Introduction of new models for understanding the world.\n- Makes a clear prediction that's backed by strong concepts and/or data.\n- Introduction of a new vision of the future.\n- Introduction of a new way of thinking about reality.\n- Recommendations for a way to behave based on the new proposed way of thinking.\n\n\"B - Fresh\" -- Proposes new ideas, but doesn't do any of the things mentioned in the \"A\" tier. Imagine a novelty score between 80% and 90% for this tier.\n\nCommon examples that meet this criteria:\n\n- Minor expansion on existing ideas, but in a way that's useful.\n\n\"C - Incremental\" -- Useful expansion or improvement of existing ideas, or a useful description of the past, but no expansion or creation of new ideas. Imagine a novelty score between 50% and 80% for this tier.\n\nCommon examples that meet this criteria:\n\n- Valuable collections of resources\n- Descriptions of the past with offered observations and takeaways\n\n\"D - Derivative\" -- Largely derivative of well-known ideas. Imagine a novelty score between in the 20% to 50% range for this tier.\n\nCommon examples that meet this criteria:\n\n- Contains ideas or facts, but they're not new in any way.\n\n\"F - Stale\" -- No new ideas whatsoever. Imagine a novelty score below 20% for this tier.\n\nCommon examples that meet this criteria:\n\n- Random ramblings that say nothing new.\n\n4. Evaluate the CLARITY of the writing on the following scale.\n\n\"A - Crystal\" -- The argument is very clear and concise, and stays in a flow that doesn't lose the main problem and solution.\n\"B - Clean\" -- The argument is quite clear and concise, and only needs minor optimizations.\n\"C - Kludgy\" -- Has good ideas, but could be more concise and more clear about the problems and solutions being proposed.\n\"D - Confusing\" -- The writing is quite confusing, and it's not clear how the pieces connect.\n\"F - Chaotic\" -- It's not even clear what's being attempted.\n\n5. Evaluate the PROSE in the writing on the following scale.\n\n\"A - Inspired\" -- Clear, fresh, distinctive prose that's free of cliche.\n\"B - Distinctive\" -- Strong writing that lacks significant use of cliche.\n\"C - Standard\" -- Decent prose, but lacks distinctive style and/or uses too much cliche or standard phrases.\n\"D - Stale\" -- Significant use of cliche and/or weak language.\n\"F - Weak\" -- Overwhelming language weakness and/or use of cliche.\n\n6. Create a bulleted list of recommendations on how to improve each rating, each consisting of no more than 16 words.\n\n7. Give an overall rating that's the lowest rating of 3, 4, and 5. So if they were B, C, and A, the overall-rating would be \"C\".\n\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- You output in Markdown, using each section header followed by the content for that section.\n- Don't use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown.\n- Liberally evaluate the criteria for NOVELTY, meaning if the content proposes a new model for doing something, makes clear recommendations for action based on a new proposed model, creatively links existing ideas in a useful way, proposes new explanations for known phenomenon, or lays out a significant vision of what's to come that's well supported, it should be rated as \"A - Novel\".\n- The overall-rating cannot be higher than the lowest rating given.\n- The overall-rating only has the letter grade, not any additional information.\n\n# INPUT:\n\nINPUT:\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Generating nuclei Command with Fabric\nDESCRIPTION: Demonstrates generating a nuclei command with Fabric for scanning a website with specific parameters for threading, output format, and rate limiting.

Vuran, Bernard Butler, Yevgeni Koucheryavy, Sasitharan Balasubramaniam\n\n### Main Goal and Fundamental Concept\n\nThe primary objective of this research is to introduce and analyze the concept of the Internet of Paint (IoP), a novel idea that integrates nano-network devices within paint to enable communication through painted surfaces using terahertz (THz) frequencies. The core hypothesis is that by embedding nano-scale radios in paint, it's possible to create a new medium for electromagnetic communication, leveraging the unique properties of THz waves for short-range, high-capacity data transmission.\n\n### Technical Approach\n\nThe study employs a comprehensive channel model to assess the communication capabilities of nano-devices embedded in paint. This model considers multipath communication strategies, including direct wave propagation, reflections from interfaces (Air-Paint and Paint-Plaster), and lateral wave propagation along these interfaces. The research evaluates the performance across three different paint types, analyzing path losses, received powers, and channel capacities to understand how THz waves interact with painted surfaces.\n\n### Distinctive Features\n\nThis research is pioneering in its exploration of paint as a medium for THz communication, marking a significant departure from traditional communication environments. The innovative aspects include:\n- The concept of integrating nano-network devices within paint (IoP).\n- A detailed channel model that accounts for the unique interaction of THz waves with painted surfaces and interfaces.\n- The examination of lateral wave propagation as a key mechanism for communication in this novel medium.\n\n### Experimental Setup and Results\n\nThe experimental analysis is based on simulations that explore the impact of frequency, line of sight (LoS) distance, and burial depth of transceivers within the paint on path loss and channel capacity. The study finds that path loss slightly increases with frequency and LoS distance, with higher refractive index paints experiencing higher path losses. Lateral waves show promising performance for communication at increased LoS distances, especially when transceivers are near the Air-Paint interface. The results also indicate a substantial reduction in channel capacity with increased LoS distance and burial depth, highlighting the need for transceivers to be closely positioned and near the Air-Paint interface for effective communication.\n\n### Advantages and Limitations\n\nThe proposed IoP approach offers several advantages, including the potential for seamless integration of communication networks into building structures without affecting aesthetics, and the ability to support novel applications like gas sensing and posture recognition. However, the study also identifies limitations, such as the reduced channel capacity compared to air-based communication channels and the challenges associated with controlling the placement and orientation of nano-devices within the paint.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Internet of Paint represents a groundbreaking step towards integrating communication capabilities directly into building materials, opening up new possibilities for smart environments. Despite its limitations, such as lower channel capacity compared to traditional air-based channels, IoP offers a unique blend of aesthetics, functionality, and innovation in communication technology. This study lays the foundation for further exploration and development in this emerging field.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Defining Steps for Tutorial Creation in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet outlines the steps the AI assistant should follow to create a DIY tutorial pattern.

They also touch upon creativity, attention spans, and the importance of introspection.\n\n## IDEAS:\n\n1. Western culture is perceived to be declining due to a loss of values and an embrace of mediocrity.\n2. Mass media and technology have contributed to shorter attention spans and a need for constant stimulation.\n3. Rilke's poetry resonates due to its focus on beauty and ecstasy in everyday objects.\n4. Subtlety is often overlooked in modern society due to sensory overload.\n5. The role of technology in shaping music and performance art is significant.\n6. Reading habits have shifted from deep, repetitive reading to consuming large quantities of new material.\n7. Revisiting influential books as one ages can lead to new insights based on accumulated wisdom and experiences.\n8. Fiction can vividly illustrate philosophical concepts through characters and narratives.\n9. Many influential thinkers have backgrounds in philosophy, highlighting its importance in shaping reasoning skills.\n10. Philosophy is seen as a bridge between theology and science, asking questions that both fields seek to answer.\n\n## QUOTES:\n\n1. \"You can't necessarily think yourself into the answers. You have to create space for the answers to come to you.\"\n2. \"The West is dying and we are killing her.\"\n3. \"The American Dream has been replaced by mass packaged mediocrity porn, encouraging us to revel like happy pigs in our own meekness.\"\n4. \"There's just not that many people who have the courage to reach beyond consensus and go explore new ideas.\"\n5. \"I'll start watching Netflix when I've read the whole of human history.\"\n6. \"Rilke saw beauty in everything... He sees it's in one little thing, a representation of all things that are beautiful.\"\n7. \"Vanilla is a very subtle flavor... it speaks to sort of the sensory overload of the modern age.\"\n8. \"When you memorize chapters [of the Bible], it takes a few months, but you really understand how things are structured.\"\n9. \"As you get older, if there's books that moved you when you were younger, it's worth going back and rereading them.\"\n10. \"She [Ayn Rand] took complicated philosophy and embodied it in a way that anybody could resonate with.\"\n\n## HABITS:\n\n1. Avoiding mainstream media consumption for deeper engagement with historical texts and personal research.\n2. Regularly revisiting influential books from youth to gain new insights with age.\n3. Engaging in deep reading practices rather than skimming or speed-reading material.\n4. Memorizing entire chapters or passages from significant texts for better understanding.\n5. Disengaging from social media and fast-paced news cycles for more focused thought processes.\n6. Walking long distances as a form of meditation and reflection.\n7. Creating space for thoughts to solidify through introspection and stillness.\n8. Embracing emotions such as grief or anger fully rather than suppressing them.\n9. Seeking out varied experiences across different careers and lifestyles.\n10. Prioritizing curiosity-driven research without specific goals or constraints.\n\n## FACTS:\n\n1. The West is perceived as declining due to cultural shifts away from traditional values.\n2. Attention spans have shortened due to technological advancements and media consumption habits.\n3. Rilke's poetry emphasizes finding beauty in everyday objects through detailed observation.\n4. Modern society often overlooks subtlety due to sensory overload from various stimuli.\n5. Reading habits have evolved from deep engagement with texts to consuming large quantities quickly.\n6. Revisiting influential books can lead to new insights based on accumulated life experiences.\n7. Fiction can effectively illustrate philosophical concepts through character development and narrative arcs.\n8. Philosophy plays a significant role in shaping reasoning skills and understanding complex ideas.\n9. Creativity may be stifled by cultural nihilism and protectionist attitudes within society.\n10. Short-term thinking undermines efforts to create lasting works of beauty or significance.\n\n## REFERENCES:\n\n1. Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry\n2. Netflix\n3. Underworld concert\n4.

I&#39;m Andrew Huberman, and I&#39;m a professor\\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Marc Andreessen. Marc Andreessen is a software engineer\\nand an investor in technology companies. He co-founded and developed\\nMosaic, which was one of the first widely used web browsers. He also co-founded and developed\\nNetscape, which was one of the earliest widespread used web browsers. And he co-founded and is a general\\npartner at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most successful Silicon\\nValley venture capital firms. All of that is to say that Mark\\nAndreessen is one of the most successful innovators and investors ever. I was extremely excited to record this\\nepisode with Marc for several reasons. First of all, he himself\\nis an incredible innovator. Second of all, he has an uncanny ability\\nto spot the innovators of the future. And third, Marc has shown over and\\nover again the ability to understand how technologies not yet even\\ndeveloped are going to impact the way that humans interact at large. Our conversation starts off by discussing\\nwhat makes for an exceptional innovator, as well as what sorts of environmental\\nconditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally. In that context, we talk about risk\\ntaking, not just in terms of risk taking in one&#39;s profession, but about how some\\npeople, not all, but how some people who are risk takers and innovators in the\\ncontext of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and\\nsome of the consequences that can bring. Then we discuss some of the most\\ntransformative technologies that are now emerging, such as novel approaches\\nto developing clean energy, as well as AI or artificial intelligence. With respect to AI, Marc shares\\nhis views as to why AI is likely to greatly improve human experience,\\nand we discuss the multiple roles that AI is very likely to have in\\nall of our lives in the near future. Marc explains how not too long from now,\\nall of us are very likely to have AI assistants, for instance, assistants that\\ngive us highly informed health advice, highly informed psychological advice. Indeed, it is very likely that all of us\\nwill soon have AI assistants that govern most, if not all, of our daily decisions. And Marc explains how, if done\\ncorrectly, this can be a tremendously positive addition to our life. In doing so, Marc provides a stark\\nargument for those that argue that AI is going to diminish human experience. So if you&#39;re hearing about and or\\nconcerned about the ways that AI is likely to destroy us today, you are\\ngoing to hear about the many different ways that AI technologies now in\\ndevelopment are likely to enhance our human experience at every level. What you&#39;ll soon find is that while\\ntoday&#39;s discussion does center around technology and technology development,\\nit is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology. So whether you have an interest in\\ntechnology development and or AI, I&#39;m certain that you&#39;ll find today&#39;s\\ndiscussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon\\nbe the future that we all live in. Before we begin, I&#39;d like to emphasize\\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire\\na nd effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about\\nscience and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I&#39;d like to\\nthank the sponsors of today&#39;s podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has\\neverything you need and nothing you don&#39;t. That means plenty of the electrolytes,\\nsodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar. The electrolytes and hydration are\\nabsolutely key for mental health, physical health, and performance. Even a slight degree of dehydration can\\nimpair our ability to think, our energy levels and our physical performance. LMNT makes it very easy to achieve\\nproper hydration, and it does so by including the three electrolytes in the\\nexact ratios they need to be present. I drink LMNT first thing in\\nthe morning when I wake up. I usually mix it with\\nabout 16 to 32oz of water. If I&#39;m exercising, I&#39;ll drink one\\nwhile I&#39;m exercising, and I tend to drink one after exercising as well. Now, many people are scared off by the\\nidea of ingesting sodium because obviously we don&#39;t want to consume sodium in excess. However, for people that have normal\\nblood pressure, and especially for people that are consuming very clean\\ndiets, that is consuming not so many processed foods or highly processed\\nfoods, oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium, magnesium and potassium,\\nand we can suffer as a consequence. And with LMNT , simply by mixing\\nin water, it tastes delicious. It&#39;s very easy to get\\nthat proper hydration. If you&#39;d like to try LMNT , you can\\ngo to drinklmnt, that&#39;s L-M-N-T, .com/huberman to claim a free element\\nsample pack with your purchase. Again, that&#39;s drinklmnt.com/huberman. Today&#39;s episode is also\\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\\ncovers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. I&#39;ve spoken many times before on this\\npodcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting a great night&#39;s sleep, is\\nthe foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance. When we&#39;re sleeping well,\\neverything goes far better. And when we are not sleeping well\\nor enough, everything gets far worse at the level of mental health,\\nphysical health and performance. Now, one of the key things to getting a\\ngreat night&#39;s sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is that you have to control the\\ntemperature of your sleeping environment. And that&#39;s because in order to\\nfall and stay deeply asleep, you need your core body temperature to\\ndrop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling\\nrefreshed and energized, you want your core body temperature to increase\\nby about one to three degrees. With Eight Sleep , it&#39;s very easy\\nto induce that drop in core body temperature by cooling your mattress\\nearly and throughout the night and warming your mattress toward morning. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\\nmattress cover a few years ago, and it has completely transformed the\\nquality of the sleep that I get. So much so that I actually loathe\\ntraveling because I don&#39;t have my Eight Sleep mattress cover when I travel. If you&#39;d like to try Eight Sleep , you can\\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman and you&#39;ll save up to $150 off their Pod 3 Cover. Eight Sleep currently ships\\nin the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in t he EU and Australia. Again, that&#39;s eightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion\\nwith Marc Andreessen. Marc, welcome. Marc Andreessen: Hey, thank you. Andrew Huberman: Delighted to\\nhave you here and have so many questions for you about innovation\\nAI, your view of the landscape of tech, and humanity in general. I want to start off by talking\\nabout innovation from three different perspectives. There&#39;s the inner game, so to speak,\\nor the psychology of the innovator, or innovators, things like their\\npropensity for engaging in conflict or not, their propensity for having a\\ndream or a vision, and in particular, their innovation as it relates to some\\npsychological trait or expression. So we&#39;ll get to that in a moment. The second component that I&#39;m\\ncurious about is the outer landscape around innovators, who they place\\nthemselves with, the sorts of choices that they make and also\\nthe sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have. And then the last component is this\\nnotion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in. What time in history? What&#39;s the geography? Bay Area, New York, Dubai, etc. So to start off, is there a common\\ntrait of innovators that you think is absolutely essential as a seed to\\ncreating things that are really impactful? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So I&#39;m not a psychologist,\\nbut I&#39;ve picked up some of the concepts and some of the terms. And so it was a great moment of delight\\nin my life when I learned about the Big Five personality traits, because I was\\nlike, aha, there&#39;s a way to actually describe the answer to this question in\\nat least reasonably scientific terms. And so I think what you&#39;re looking\\nfor, when you&#39;re talking about real innovators, like people who actually do\\nreally creative breakthrough work, I think you&#39;re talking about a couple of things. So one is very high in what&#39;s called\\ntrait openness, which is one of the Big Five, which is basically just\\nlike, flat out open to new ideas. And of course, the nature of trait\\nopenness is trait openness means you&#39;re not just open to new ideas\\nin one category, you&#39;re open to many different kinds of new ideas. And so we might talk about the\\nfact that a lot of innovators also are very creative people in other\\naspects of their lives, even outside of their specific creative domain. So that&#39;s important. But of course, just being open is not\\nsufficient, because if you&#39;re just open, you could just be curious and\\nexplore and spend your entire life reading and doing, talking to people\\nand never actually create something. So you also need a couple of other things. You need a high level of\\nconscientiousness, which is another one of the Big Five.\"\n}\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Configuring Fabric Templates with Default Prompts in YAML\nDESCRIPTION: This YAML configuration snippet defines a Fabric setup with default prompts and multiple templates.

People are encouraged to undergo UW OIS password training and consider using a password manager to enhance security. It's crucial not to reuse their NETID password for the vendor account.\n\n2) Incident Response Contact: The owner/user will be the primary point of contact in case of a data breach. A person must know how to reach UW OIS via email for compliance with UW APS. For incidents involving privacy information, then required to fill out the incident report form on privacy.uw.edu.\n\n3) Data Backup: It's recommended to regularly back up. Ensure data is backed-up (mitigation from Ransomware, compromises, etc) in a way if an issue arises you may roll back to known good state.\n\n Data local to your laptop or PC, preferably backup to cloud storage such as UW OneDrive, to mitigate risks such as data loss, ransomware, or issues with vendor software. Details on storage options are available on itconnect.uw.edu and specific link in below Appendix.\n\n4) Records Retention: Adhere to Records Retention periods as required by RCW 40.14.050. Further guidance can be found on finance.uw.edu/recmgt/retentionschedules.\n\n5) Device Security: If any data will reside on a laptop, Follow the UW-IT OIS guidelines provided on itconnect.uw.edu for securing laptops.\n\n6) Software Patching: Routinely patch the vendor application. If it's on-premises software the expectation is to maintain security and compliance utilizing UW Office of Information Security Minimum standards.\n\n7) Review Terms of Use (of Vendor)  and vendors Privacy Policy with all the security/privacy implications it poses.

They also touch upon creativity, attention spans, and the importance of introspection.\n\n## IDEAS:\n\n1. Western culture is perceived to be declining due to a loss of values and an embrace of mediocrity.\n2. Mass media and technology have contributed to shorter attention spans and a need for constant stimulation.\n3. Rilke's poetry resonates due to its focus on beauty and ecstasy in everyday objects.\n4. Subtlety is often overlooked in modern society due to sensory overload.\n5. The role of technology in shaping music and performance art is significant.\n6. Reading habits have shifted from deep, repetitive reading to consuming large quantities of new material.\n7. Revisiting influential books as one ages can lead to new insights based on accumulated wisdom and experiences.\n8. Fiction can vividly illustrate philosophical concepts through characters and narratives.\n9. Many influential thinkers have backgrounds in philosophy, highlighting its importance in shaping reasoning skills.\n10. Philosophy is seen as a bridge between theology and science, asking questions that both fields seek to answer.\n\n## QUOTES:\n\n1. \"You can't necessarily think yourself into the answers. You have to create space for the answers to come to you.\"\n2. \"The West is dying and we are killing her.\"\n3. \"The American Dream has been replaced by mass packaged mediocrity porn, encouraging us to revel like happy pigs in our own meekness.\"\n4. \"There's just not that many people who have the courage to reach beyond consensus and go explore new ideas.\"\n5. \"I'll start watching Netflix when I've read the whole of human history.\"\n6. \"Rilke saw beauty in everything... He sees it's in one little thing, a representation of all things that are beautiful.\"\n7. \"Vanilla is a very subtle flavor... it speaks to sort of the sensory overload of the modern age.\"\n8. \"When you memorize chapters [of the Bible], it takes a few months, but you really understand how things are structured.\"\n9. \"As you get older, if there's books that moved you when you were younger, it's worth going back and rereading them.\"\n10. \"She [Ayn Rand] took complicated philosophy and embodied it in a way that anybody could resonate with.\"\n\n## HABITS:\n\n1. Avoiding mainstream media consumption for deeper engagement with historical texts and personal research.\n2. Regularly revisiting influential books from youth to gain new insights with age.\n3. Engaging in deep reading practices rather than skimming or speed-reading material.\n4. Memorizing entire chapters or passages from significant texts for better understanding.\n5. Disengaging from social media and fast-paced news cycles for more focused thought processes.\n6. Walking long distances as a form of meditation and reflection.\n7. Creating space for thoughts to solidify through introspection and stillness.\n8. Embracing emotions such as grief or anger fully rather than suppressing them.\n9. Seeking out varied experiences across different careers and lifestyles.\n10. Prioritizing curiosity-driven research without specific goals or constraints.\n\n## FACTS:\n\n1. The West is perceived as declining due to cultural shifts away from traditional values.\n2. Attention spans have shortened due to technological advancements and media consumption habits.\n3. Rilke's poetry emphasizes finding beauty in everyday objects through detailed observation.\n4. Modern society often overlooks subtlety due to sensory overload from various stimuli.\n5. Reading habits have evolved from deep engagement with texts to consuming large quantities quickly.\n6. Revisiting influential books can lead to new insights based on accumulated life experiences.\n7. Fiction can effectively illustrate philosophical concepts through character development and narrative arcs.\n8. Philosophy plays a significant role in shaping reasoning skills and understanding complex ideas.\n9. Creativity may be stifled by cultural nihilism and protectionist attitudes within society.\n10. Short-term thinking undermines efforts to create lasting works of beauty or significance.\n\n## REFERENCES:\n\n1. Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry\n2. Netflix\n3. Underworld concert\n4.

Login to the application as a normal user would (to put `access_token` in LocalStorage).\n2. Visit `https://site.com/renderHTML?HTMLCode=<script>alert(localStorage.getItem(\"access_token\")</script>` and note your `access_token` has been stolen.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n## Impact:\nIt is possible to use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript in the victims browser under the `site.com` origin.\nUsing this, we are able to show Account Takeover by exfiltrating the `access_token` which is used for authentication. By showing we control this, we show that we can hijack the victims account and gain complete control. We are able to read and modify all data on the victims account.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: File Management Input Structure JSON\nDESCRIPTION: Example input JSON structure showing directory contents, file reporting, and instruction directives for code changes\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_coding_feature/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: json\nCODE:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"type\": \"directory\",\n        \"name\": \".\",\n        \"contents\": [\n            {\n                 \"type\": \"file\",\n                \"name\": \"README.md\",\n                \"content\": \"This is the README.md file content\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"file\",\n                \"name\": \"system.md\",\n                \"content\": \"This is the system.md file contents\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"report\",\n        \"directories\": 1,\n        \"files\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"instructions\",\n        \"name\": \"code_change_instructions\",\n        \"details\": \"Update README and refactor main.py\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Defining Custom Markdown Tags for Styling\nDESCRIPTION: Specifies custom HTML tags to be used for styling in the converted markdown, including callouts and blockquotes with citations.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/sanitize_broken_html_to_markdown/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n<callout></callous> for wrapping a callous\n\n<blockquote><cite></cite>></blockquote> for matching a block quote (note the embedded citation in there where applicable)\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Defining Identity and Purpose in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: Establishes the identity and purpose of the wisdom extraction service, focusing on topics related to life's purpose, technology's role in humanity's future, AI, and continuous improvement.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_article_wisdom/dmiessler/extract_wisdom-1.0.0/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are a wisdom extraction service for text content.

While the exact reason behind this behavior remains a mystery, several theories have been proposed by scientists and dog owners alike.\n\nThe Ancient Instinct\n\nSome believe that this spinning behavior is a remnant of the dogs' wild ancestors. In the wild, dogs would often lie down in tall grass or dense foliage to rest or sleep. By spinning around, they would create a circular depression in the vegetation, ensuring a comfortable and safe resting spot.\n\nThe Comfort Seeker\n\nAnother theory suggests that dogs spin to create a sense of comfort and security. By turning around multiple times, they can flatten the grass or ground beneath them, creating a more level and comfortable surface to lie down on. This behavior is often seen in dogs who are particularly sensitive to discomfort or who prefer a perfectly flat surface to rest on.\n\nThe Scent Marker\n\nA third theory proposes that dogs spin to leave their scent on the ground. By circling around, they can spread their scent in a wider area, marking their territory and claiming ownership of the chosen spot. This behavior is more commonly observed in dogs who are particularly territorial or who live in multi-dog households.\n\nThe Playful Spirit\n\nFinally, some dog owners believe that spinning is simply a playful behavior. Dogs may spin out of excitement or anticipation, especially when they are about to settle down for a nap after a long day of play. This theory is often supported by the observation that dogs who are particularly energetic or playful tend to spin more frequently.\n\nA Combination of Factors\n\nWhile the exact reason behind dog spinning remains unknown, it is likely a combination of these factors. Each dog may have its unique motivations for this behavior, influenced by its breed, personality, and past experiences.\n\nObserving Your Dog\n\nIf you have a dog that spins before settling down, you can try to observe its behavior to gain a better understanding of its motivations. Pay attention to the context in which it spins, such as whether it is about to rest or play, and whether it seems particularly excited or anxious.\n\nBy observing your dog's behavior, you may be able to uncover the unique reasons behind its spinning ritual.\n```\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Configuring Access Control Lists in Cisco IOS\nDESCRIPTION: This command sequence creates an access control list (ACL) in Cisco IOS.

It's a pretty common thing, but why do they do it?  Nobody's entirely sure, but there are a few good guesses.\n\nOne idea is that it's an instinct from their wolf ancestors.  Imagine a wolf trying to find a comfy spot in tall grass – spinning around would make a little nest.\n\nAnother thought is that it's all about comfort.  Spinning flattens things out, making a nice, even spot for a nap. You see this a lot in dogs who are picky about where they sleep.\n\nSome people think it's about marking their territory.  Spinning spreads their scent, kind of like saying, \"This is mine!\"  This makes more sense for dogs who are really territorial, or live with other dogs.\n\nAnd then there's the \"it's just fun\" theory.  Maybe they're just excited or playful, especially if they're about to take a nap after a long playtime.\n\nIt's probably a mix of all these things.  Every dog is different, so their reasons might be a little different too.  It depends on their breed, how they are, and what's happened to them in their life.\n\nIf your dog does this, try watching them.  What are they doing right before they start spinning? Are they tired, or excited?  Paying attention might give you a clue about why *your* dog does it.  It's a fun little mystery to solve together!\n```\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Markdown Output Format Template\nDESCRIPTION: A template showing the required format for outputting subject, learning objectives, and associated review questions with answer placeholders\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_quiz/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\nSubject: \n* Learning objective: \n    - Question 1: {generated question 1}\n    - Answer 1: \n\n    - Question 2: {generated question 2}\n    - Answer 2:\n    \n    - Question 3: {generated question 3}\n    - Answer 3:\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Importing Fabric in Python\nDESCRIPTION: Example of how to import and use the Fabric module in a Python script.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_recommendations/user.md#2025-04-22_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: python\nCODE:\n```\nimport fabric\n\nfabric.get_prompt('analysis')\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Suggesting Fabric Patterns (Markdown)\nDESCRIPTION: Key pattern for suggesting appropriate fabric patterns or commands based on user input.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/pattern_explanations.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n**suggest_pattern**, suggests appropriate fabric patterns or commands based on user input.**\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Providing Output Instructions for Logo Generation in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet lists specific instructions for generating the logo prompt, emphasizing simplicity, vector graphics, and Markdown format.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_logo/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- Ensure the description asks for a simple, vector graphic logo.\n- Do not output anything other than the raw image description that will be sent to the image generator.\n- You only output human-readable Markdown.\n- Do not output warnings or notes —- just the requested sections.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Specifying Output Sections for Logo Generation in Markdown\nDESCRIPTION: This snippet defines the output section, instructing the creation of a prompt for AI image generators to produce a simple and elegant vector graphic logo.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_logo/system.md#2025-04-22_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\n# OUTPUT SECTIONS\n\n- Output a prompt that can be sent to an AI image generator for a simple and elegant logo that captures and incorporates the meaning of the input sent.
