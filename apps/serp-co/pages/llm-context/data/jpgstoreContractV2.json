    "content": "TITLE: Compiling Plutus Contract\nDESCRIPTION: This script compiles the Plutus smart contract. It's assumed that the script is executed from the project's root directory. The compilation process generates the necessary Plutus Core script.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nscripts/compile.sh\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Sourcing Environment Variable Files\nDESCRIPTION: This command sources an environment variable file, setting multiple environment variables at once.  It's a convenient way to configure the testing environment quickly.  Ensure the paths to the `cardano-node` socket are correct for your system.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nsource scripts/envars/testnet.envs\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH\nDESCRIPTION: This command sets the `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` environment variable, which is required to interact with the Cardano node.  The path should point to the Daedalus socket file for either the Testnet or Mainnet Daedalus. If you are running your own `cardano-node`, you should set it to your own socket file location.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_1\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nexport CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=<your node path>\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running Cabal Tests\nDESCRIPTION: This command executes the test suite using `cabal`. Before running the tests, ensure that all required environment variables are correctly configured. The tests are defined in the `integration-tests/Main.hs` file.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_6\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\ncabal test\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting WALLET_DIR\nDESCRIPTION: This command sets the `WALLET_DIR` environment variable, which points to a directory containing the signing key (`.skey`) and verification key (`.vkey`) files for various wallets (seller1, seller2, buyer, marketplace, royalties).  If the files don't exist, the tests will create them and transfer 100 ada.  If the variable is not set, a temporary directory will be used.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_2\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nexport WALLET_DIR=<dir with wallet skey and vkey files>\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS_PATH and SOURCE_WALLET_SKEY_PATH\nDESCRIPTION: These commands set the `SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS_PATH` and `SOURCE_WALLET_SKEY_PATH` environment variables. They define the paths to the wallet address and signing key that will be used as a source of funds when creating new wallets. If the `WALLET_DIR` is set and all wallets already exist, these variables will not be used.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_3\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nexport SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS_PATH=<path to user addr file>\nexport SOURCE_WALLET_SKEY_PATH=<path to user skey file>\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting TESTNET_MAGIC\nDESCRIPTION: This command sets the `TESTNET_MAGIC` environment variable, which specifies the magic number for the testnet.  If this variable is not set, mainnet will be assumed.  Setting the correct magic number is crucial for the tests to run correctly on the intended network.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/jpg-store/contract-v2/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nexport TESTNET_MAGIC=1097911063\n```"
