The limitations of complexity of this system were overdone.\n- The following changes below are more responsive and much easier to understand.\n\nAthena.document.character\n- A 'character' specific document with individual state updates for all interface values.\n- Includes better extendability for core interfaces through generic types.\n- Adds functions: get, getField, set, setBulk, onChange\n- Fixed small issue with references\n\nAthena.document.vehicle\n- A 'vehicle' specific document with individual state updates for all interface values.\n- Includes better extendability for core interfaces through generic types.\n- Adds functions: get, getField, set, setBulk, onChange\n\nAthena.player.save (Removed)\n- Removed this in favor of the above changes (Athena.document.character)\n- Moved the onTick function to the onTick file, and exposed with export.\n\nCurrency\n- Updated currency logic to allow old / new value watching.\n- Uses new document system to log new / old data changes.\n- Removes direct modifiction of player.data.x\n- Added Custom Currency Type Support\n\nChat\n- Began moving chat into its own self-contained plugin.\n- Removed decorator system.\n- Chat Vue interface reworked with lots of individual configurations.\n- Added pgup/pgdn controls for pagination\n- Began work on input rmlui for commands / text inputs\n- Finished command suggestions above input box\n- Created new command input rmlui option\n- Created message history in command input\n- TAB -> AutoFills with bottom command.\n- UP -> Goes to previously sent message or command\n- Down -> Navigates to previously sent messages, or fills with empty message\n- Known Issue: Input Caret does not go to the end of the input box. There is nothing that can be done to fix this currently.\n\nPermission System\n- Began refactor on permission system to use array of 'strings' to assign permissions.\n- Allows a player to have multiple permissions such as: ['admin', 'moderator']\n- No hierarchy will be created, and simply appending / removing these strings will enable / disable commands.\n- Character Permissions\n-- addPerm - Adds a permission to a player's account.\n-- removePerm - Removes a permission from a player's account.\n-- has - Check if a player has a permission given a string.\n-- hasOne - Check if a player has at least one permission given an array of strings.\n-- hasAll - Check if a player has all permissions given an array of strings.\n-- clear - Clears all permissions associated with a player.\n- Account Permissions\n-- addPerm - Adds a permission to a player's account.\n-- removePerm - Removes a permission from a player's account.\n-- has - Check if a player has a permission given a string.\n-- hasOne - Check if a player has at least one permission given an array of strings.\n-- hasAll - Check if a player has all permissions given an array of strings.\n-- clear - Clears all permissions associated with a player.\n\nMessenger System\n- Handles messages to be sent to some form of chat system.\n- Allows for client-side, and server-side callbacks to handle messages sent between players and server and client.\n- By default the messenger system will simply log to console if no chat systems are registered with Athena.\n-- This also applies to client-side.\n- Command logic being reworked to get more in-depth responses about what may be missing from a command based on args passed.\n- Command logic works with new permission system stated above.\n- Old permissions system is being deprecated.\n- Added timestamps to client-side message history.\n- Added a client history callback listener.\n- Added way to differentiate between a character permission command, and an account permission command\n- By default all commands use account permissions\n\nGetters\n- Added Athena.get.players.inRangeWithDistance - Returns players and their distance from a position.\n\nRefactors\n- Update existing code base to use new Athena.document APIs\n\nVue Dev Menu\n- Added 'Hide' Button\n- Added 'Hide on Refresh' Button\n\nItem Interface\n- Initial Type Definitions & Design\n\nItem Factory\n- Created Initial Item Factory Functions\n- Created way to upsert new items into Item Factory\n- Created way to obtain a 'base item' from the Item Factory\n- Created a way to convert a 'stored item' from the Item Factory into a 'full item'\n- Created a way to convert a 'full item' from the Item Factory into a 'stored item'\n- Created weight calculations when using these functions\n\nItem Manager\n- Created Item Manager Functions\n-- quantity\n--- add - Adds a quantity to an item.

Recovery in Cryptography\nDESCRIPTION: An excerpt explaining the statistical security of BIP39 seed phrases, noting that a 12-word seed phrase has 2^132 possible combinations, making collisions virtually impossible. The text compares this number to astronomical quantities to illustrate the improbability of two identical seed phrases.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/stuyk/altv-athena/blob/master/src/core/plugins/basic-auth/README.md#2025-04-21_snippet_0\n\nLANGUAGE: markdown\nCODE:\n```\nTheoretically, there's nothing to prevent two people from getting the same BIP39 seed phrase — it could happen. However, the chances of that actually occurring are exceptionally remote.\n\nThe BIP39 seed word list contains 2,048 words, so a 12-word seed phrase has about 2048^12 = 2^132  possible combinations, which is about 5.44 X 1039 in scientific notation. \n\nThat's an impossibly large number: For comparison, the known universe contains an estimated 70 x 1023 stars, and there are about 75 x 717 grains of sand on Earth.\n\nThe total number of cryptocurrency wallets is insignificant compared to the number of possible seed phrases. Put simply, it's virtually impossible for two people to receive the same seed phrase. You would have a much better chance of winning the lottery several times in a row.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Checking Account Permissions in Athena
