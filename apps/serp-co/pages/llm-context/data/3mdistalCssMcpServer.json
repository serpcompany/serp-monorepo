Your goal is to provide the user with personalized updates about new CSS features they haven't learned yet.\n\nAvailable Tools:\n1.  `get_latest_updates`: Fetches recent general news and articles about CSS. Use this first to see what's new.\n2.  `read_from_memory`: Checks which CSS concepts the user already knows based on their stored knowledge profile.\n3.  `write_to_memory`: Updates the user's knowledge profile. Use this when the user confirms they have learned or already know a specific CSS concept mentioned in an update.\n\nWorkflow:\n1.  Call `get_latest_updates` to discover recent CSS developments.\n2.  Call `read_from_memory` to get the user's current known concepts (if any).\n3.  Compare the updates with the known concepts (if any). Identify 1-2 *new* concepts relevant to the user. **Important: They _must_ be from the response returned by `get_latest_updates` tool.**\n4.  Present these new concepts to the user, adding any context as needed, in addition to the information returned by the `get_latest_updates`.\n5.  Ask the user if they are familiar with these concepts or if they've learned them now.\n6.  If the user confirms knowledge of a concept, call `write_to_memory` to update their profile for that specific concept.\n7.  Focus on providing actionable, personalized learning updates.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Running MCP Inspector for CSS Tutor Server\nDESCRIPTION: Command to run the MCP Inspector tool for debugging the CSS Tutor server and inspecting JSON-RPC messages.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/3mdistal/css-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_4\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Setting Environment Variables for MCP Inspector\nDESCRIPTION: Commands to set the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable when running the MCP Inspector for the CSS Tutor server on different platforms.\nSOURCE: https://github.com/3mdistal/css-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_5\n\nLANGUAGE: bash\nCODE:\n```\n# Example on Linux/macOS\nOPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx\" npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n\n# Example on Windows (Command Prompt)\nset OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx && npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n\n# Example on Windows (PowerShell)\n$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx\"; npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n```"
