      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>10 years ago, we started SERP as a simple SEO agency.</p>
      <p>
        Our scope was smaller, but our drive was the same as it is today:
        helping underdogs win against the giants.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've always fought for the little guy and found ways to help them pull
        off the digital version of David v Goliath.
      </p>

      <p>Then the playing field tilted even further.</p>

      <p>
        AI advanced at breakneck speed, creating an unprecedented advantage for
        tech giants with deep pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
        These companies leveraged collective data from billions of users to
        train powerful AI systems, then locked those capabilities behind
        expensive paywalls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gap between digital haves and have-nots widened into a chasm. The
        same technologies that promised to democratize opportunity instead
        concentrated power in fewer hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        The window to change this trajectory is closing rapidly. We may not get
        another chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digital power must return to its rightful owners before it's too late.
      </p>

      <h2>For Individuals</h2>
      <p>
        We believe AI and digital tools shouldn't be locked behind corporate
        paywalls. This technology was built using everyone's online
        contributions, and now we're being charged for the fruits of that labor.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we've set out to create as many free tools and resources for the
        individual as we can.
      </p>

        power back in your hands.

      <p>
        So, if you see yourself as someone who likes to fight for the
        individual, instead of the large corporations, we want your help.
      </p>

      <p>The digital world shouldn't just work for the privileged few.</p>

      <p>Let's build it differently together, before we lose our shot.</p>

      <p>
        Join the SERP Alliance and help secure the future of the internet for
        the individual.
